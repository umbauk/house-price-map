/* Bugs:
[ ] propertyDetails array seems to have too many results returned
*/

/* To do:
[x] display Map
[x] put text on address (get address, format, send to Maps API, receive back coords, put text at coords)
[x] upload price data to MongoDB
[x] write server code
[x] connect MongoDB to app
[x] collate coords for addresses
[x] put all prices on map
[x] only pull from mongoDB the coordinates for houses within current map view e.g. where lat < lat of top/bottom of screen
[x] remove markers when zoom out, add markers when zoom in
[x] when click prices, open info window with address, sale date and sale price (may be more than one sale date and price)
[x] when have same/very similar coordinates, collapse into one box with list of addresses and prices (e.g. apartments)
[x] populate coordinates from shanelynn.ie data
[x] Add text box for users to search for address
[x] If zoom in from home screen, prices appear
[ ] Add FAQ / Info button and pop up (include summary stats)
[ ] calculate today prices of properties, Add toggle button to convert all prices to today's prices
[ ] Add pipeline to upload new prices as come available including getting coordinates
[ ] Manually add coordinates for lat: 0 properties (or tidy up addresses)
[ ] handle VAT on new properties
[ ] put estimated prices on map for all houses that don't have price data properties
  - find all addresses on street or within certain bounds


Stretch:
[ ] Ability for users to submit corrections/new data e.g. add new addresses, move markers, correct amounts
